React CRUD Operations
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of CRUD operations using React.js. It allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete items from a list, providing a practical example of how to manage state and interact with a mock backend or API. The application utilizes React’s useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and fetching data.

Features:
Create: Add a new item to the list with user input.
Read: Display a list of items retrieved from an API or stored locally.
Update: Edit an existing item’s data directly within the app.
Delete: Remove an item from the list.
Technologies Used:
React.js for building the user interface.
React hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing application state and side effects.
Basic CSS for styling.
